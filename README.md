# M3U Playlist Proxy Worker

`proxy_worker.js` is a Cloudflare Worker that proxies M3U playlists (e.g., IPTV or video streams) from URLs like GitHub raw links. It caches playlists and streams for fast, low-latency playback and supports HLS (`.m3u8`) and standard M3U playlists for use in players like VLC or browser-based players with HLS.js.

## Features
- Proxies M3U playlists via `?url=<m3u-url>` with CORS headers.
- Rewrites stream URLs to `/proxy?url=stream_link` for caching and low-latency delivery.
- Caches playlists (5 min) and streams (1 hr) using Cloudflareâ€™s edge network.
- Root path (`/`) returns `"working as intended"`.
- Works with IPTV players (e.g., VLC) and browser players.

## Setup
1. **Get the Script**:
   - Download `proxy_worker.js` from this repository.
2. **Create Worker**:
   - Log in to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
   - Go to **Workers & Pages** > **Create Worker**.
   - Name it (e.g., `m3u-proxy`).
3. **Deploy**:
   - Paste `proxy_worker.js` into the Worker editor.
   - Click **Save and Deploy**.
   - Your Worker runs at `https://smoke.roti.dpdns.org`.

## Usage
